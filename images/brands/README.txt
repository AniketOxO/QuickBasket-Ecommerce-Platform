Local placeholder SVGs for brand logos used as first fallback:
- sprite.svg
- fanta.svg
- nestle.svg

Replace these with official brand SVGs if you have them. Keep filenames and the 64x64 viewBox. The app prefers these local files before trying CDN sources, ensuring the logos display even offline or when CDNs are blocked.
